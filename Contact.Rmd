I'm always happy to chat! If you are interested in collaborating, want to request stimuli, papers, etc., or just want to chat science, feel free to reach out! (nicholas.maxwell@msutexas.edu). Most of my research materials are openly available via [OSF](https://osf.io/uxdvh/)

## For students:
Are you a potential graduate student interested in the clinical/counseling MA at MSU Texas? You can check out the program requirements [here](https://msutexas.edu/academics/libarts/psychology/ma/).


If you are a current MSU Texas undergraduate student interested in doing memory research with me, please download this form and fill it out. Email it back to me along with a copy of your resume.
