If you are interested in collaborating or just want to talk science, feel free to reach out via email! (nicholas.maxwell@msutexas.edu). Generally speaking, I'm always happy to chat! If you'd like access to papers, stimuli, or other various, research materials, I have made most of this available via [OSF](https://osf.io/uxdvh/). If you can't find something, just ask!

## For students:
Are you a potential graduate student interested in the clinical/counseling MA at MSU Texas? You can check out the program requirements [here](https://msutexas.edu/academics/libarts/psychology/ma/).


If you are a current MSU Texas undergraduate student interested in doing memory research with me, please download this form and fill it out. Email it back to me along with a copy of your resume.
