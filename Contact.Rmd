<br>

If you are interested in collaborating or just want to talk science, feel free to reach out via email! (nicholas.maxwell@msutexas.edu). Generally speaking, I'm always happy to chat! If you'd like access to papers, stimuli, or other various, research materials, I have made most of this available via [OSF](https://osf.io/uxdvh/). If you can't find something, just ask!
