Hello! I’m Nicholas Maxwell. I’m currently an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, TX where I lead the Memory, Metamemory, and Learning lab.

My research focuses on human memory and metamemory. Specifically, I’m interested in the degree to which individuals can accurately predict later test performance, what factors influence the accuracy of their predictions, and whether or not making memory predictions in general can benefit memory (vs. not making predictions). For more information about my research, please take a look at the Research page. I also have links to various teaching materials, my CV, and direct links to some R shiny applications that I have developed to facilitate research in cognitive psychology.

In addition to researching memory, I’m also interested in big data, predictive modeling, and how the two can be used to solve theoretical and practical problems. I’m also an advocate for open science practices and research transparency.

I’m always happy to chat science! Please feel free to reach out to me at nicholas.maxwell@msutexas.edu. Thanks for stopping by!
